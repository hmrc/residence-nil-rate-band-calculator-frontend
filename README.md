This service provides a frontend for the [residence nil-rate band](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inheritance-tax-residence-nil-rate-band) calculator service.

### Requirements
This service is written in Scala and Play 2.5, so needs at least a JRE to run.

### Running locally
To run the service locally:

    sbt 'run 7111'

You will also need to have the [residence nil-rate band calculator](https://github.com/hmrc/residence-nil-rate-band-calculator) service and
[Assets Frontend](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend) running.  You can start these manually, or use the following [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager) commands:

    sm --start RNRB
    sm --start ASSETS_FRONTEND
