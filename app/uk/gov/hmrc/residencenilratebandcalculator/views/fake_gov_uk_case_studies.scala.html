                                <p>As the home passes to the grandchildren under the terms of Mrs G’s will, <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £150,000 will be available.</p>

                                <p>He leaves his £450,000 home to his wife, and everything else to his children.</p>

                                <p>Without the effect of tapering, Mr J would have unused <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £125,000.

                                <p>She dies in August 2020 with no home in her estate.</p>

                                <p>Mrs K’s estate is also entitled to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £175,000.</p>

                                <p>To calculate the lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr>:</p>

                                <p>Step 1. The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> when the home was sold was £125,000. Mrs K’s estate is also entitled to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £175,000 when she dies. So the total <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> that could have been  available when the home was sold is £300,000 (£125,000 + £175,000).</p>

                                <p>Step 2. The home was worth £195,000 when it was sold. You divide this by the value at step 1 (£300,000) to give a percentage of 65%.</p>

                                <p>Step 3. There’s no home in the estate at the date of death, so the percentage is 0%.</p>

                                <p>Step 4. Taking 0% from 65% gives a percentage of 65%.</p>

                                <p>Step 5. When Mrs K dies, the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> is £175,000. Her estate is also entitled to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £175,000, so the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> for Mrs K’s estate is £350,000. The ‘lost’ <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> is £227,500 (65% of £350,000).</p>

                                <p>Although the lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr>  is £227,500, the amount of the downsizing addition actually available to Mrs K’s estate depends on the value of any other assets that are left to Mrs K’s direct descendants.</p>

                                <p>When Mrs L dies in the tax year 2020 to 2021 her estate is worth £700,000. She leaves the bungalow worth £200,000 to her sister.</p>

                                <p>She leaves other assets worth £500,000 to her children.</p>

                                <p>Step 1. The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> when the house was sold was £125,000.</p>

                                <p>Step 2. The house was worth £450,000 when it was sold. Divide this by the figure at step 1 to give a percentage of 360%. But as the value of the house is more than the figure at step 1, the percentage is limited to 100%.</p>

                                <p>Step 3. The bungalow at the date of death is worth £200,000. Divide this by the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> available at death (£175,000). This would be 114.3%, but again is limited to 100%.</p>

                                <p>Step 4. Take away the percentage at step 3 (100%) from the percentage at step 2 (100%). This gives a percentage of 0%.</p>

                                <p>Step 5. Multiply the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at death (£175,000) by the percentage at step 4 (0%), to give a total of lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £Nil.</p>

                                <p>As the percentage at step 4 is 0%, there’s no lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> and there can be no downsizing addition.</p>

                                <p>Step 2. The house was worth £500,000 when it was sold. Divide this by the figure at step 1, but limit the percentage to 100%.</p>

                                <p>Step 3. The flat is worth £105,000 when Mr M dies. Divide this by the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> available at death (£175,000). This gives a percentage of 60%.</p>

                                <p>Step 4. Take away the percentage at step 3 (60%) from the percentage at step 2 (100%) to give a percentage of 40%.</p>

                                <p>Step 5. Multiply the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at death (£175,000) by the percentage at step 4 (40%) to give a total of lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £70,000.</p>

                                <p>The actual amount of the downsizing addition depends on the value of other assets that are left to Mr M’s children.</p>

                                <p>As Mr M leaves more than £70,000 of other assets to his daughters, the downsizing addition of £70,000 is added to the <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> due for the flat of £105,000 left to his son. This gives a total <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> for the estate of £175,000.</p>

                                <p>If instead Mr M had left the flat to his son, some assets worth £50,000 to his daughters, and the rest of his estate to his wife, the downsizing addition would be restricted to £50,000. This is because that’s the value of other assets he left to his daughters.</p>

                                <p>The total <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> in that case would be £155,000 (£105,000 + £50,000).</p>

                                <p>Step 5. Multiply the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at death (£175,00) by the percentage at step 4 (40%), to give a total of lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £70,000.</p>

                                <p>Mr N only leaves half of the bungalow to his son. So you reduce the <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> due for that home £52,500 (50% of £105,000).</p>

                                <p>As  Mr N leaves other assets of £150,000 to his daughter, the downsizing addition is £70,000 (the lower of the lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £70,000 and £150,000).</p>

                                <p>You add this to the <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> due for the bungalow of £52,500, to give a total <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £122,500 (£52,500 + £70,000).</p>

                                <p>The maximum available <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> is £175,000, but Mr N’s estate can only use £122,500. So there’s unused <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £52,500 available to be transferred to Mrs N’s estate.</p>

                                <p>If the assets left to the daughter were worth only £20,000, the downsizing addition would be restricted to £20,000. So the total <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> for the estate would be £72,500 (£52,500 + £20,000).</p>

                                <p>There’d be unused <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £102,500 available for transfer.</p>

                                <h3 id="case-study-15-how-to-work-out-the-downsizing-addition-where-downsizing-occurs-before-6-april-2017">Case study 15: how to work out the downsizing addition where downsizing occurs before 6 April 2017</h3>

                                <p>Mr and Mrs O downsized in March 2016 from a house they owned jointly, worth £300,000, to an apartment. As the move happened before 6 April 2017, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> treat the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> in March 2016 as being £100,000.</p>

                                <p>When Mrs O dies in December 2019, she leaves her half share of the apartment, worth £105,000, to her husband. She leaves other assets in her estate worth £80,000 to her step-daughter.</p>

                                <p>The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> due in tax year 2019 to 2020 is £150,000.</p>

                                <p>There’s no entitlement to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> on Mrs O’s death.</p>

                                <p>Step 1. The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at the date of sale is treated as being £100,000 because the downsizing happens before 6 April 2017.</p>

                                <p>Step 2. The house was worth £400,000 when it was sold. Divide this by the figure at step 1, but limit the percentage to 100%.</p>

                                <p>Step 3. The apartment is worth £105,000 when Mrs O dies. Divide this by the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> available at death (£150,000) to give a percentage of 70%.</p>

                                <p>Step 4. Take away the percentage at step 3 (70%) from the percentage at step 2 (100%) to give a percentage of 30%.</p>

                                <p>Step 5. Multiply the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at death (£150,000) by the percentage at step 4 (30%) to give a total of lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £45,000.</p>

                                <p>Because the apartment was left to Mrs O’s husband there’s no <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> due for the share in that home.</p>

                                <p>The downsizing addition is the lower of the lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> (£45,000) or the amount of other assets left to the step-daughter (£80,000). So the downsizing addition is £45,000 in this case.</p>

                                <p>The total <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> for the estate is therefore £45,000 due to the downsizing addition.</p>

                                <p>Mrs O’s estate had a maximum available <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £150,000, but it can only use £45,000. So there’s unused <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £105,000 available to be transferred to Mr O’s estate.</p>

                                <p>If the value of the assets left to the daughter had only been £10,000, the downsizing addition would be reduced to £10,000. So the total <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> for the estate would be £10,000. In that case the unused <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> available for transfer would be £140,000.</p>

                                <p>Mrs P sold her home for £285,000 in October 2018 to go into residential care. The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> in the tax year 2018 to 2019 is £125,000.</p>

                                <p>She dies in March 2021 with an estate worth £500,000.</p>

                                <p>She leaves half of her estate to her son and half to her nephew.</p>

                                <p>The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> due in tax year 2020 to 2021 is £175,000.</p>

                                <p>There’s no entitlement to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> on Mrs P’s death.</p>

                                <p>Step 1. The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at the date of sale was £125,000.</p>

                                <p>Step 2. The house was sold for £285,000. Divide this by the figure at step 1, but limit the percentage to 100%.</p>

                                <p>Step 3. There’s no home in the estate at death so the percentage here is 0%.</p>

                                <p>Step 4. Take away the percentage at step 3 (0%) from the percentage at step 2 (100%). The percentage at step 2 is unaltered and remains 100%.</p>

                                <p>Step 5. Multiply the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at death (£175,000) by 100%, so the total lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> is £175,000.</p>

                                <p>The value of the home at the time of the sale is more than the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at that time so the whole of the <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> has been lost.</p>

                                <p>Before she downsized, Mrs P’s estate could have qualified for the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at that time. When Mrs P dies, the lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr>  as a result of the downsizing is therefore £175,000.</p>

                                <p>The downsizing addition is the lower of the value of other assets that are left to a direct descendant and the lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr>.</p>

                                <p>As Mrs P leaves £250,000 of other assets to her son, a downsizing addition of £175,000 is due.</p>

                                <p>If instead Mrs P had only left £100,000 to her son and the rest of her estate to her nephew, the downsizing addition would be restricted to £100,000.</p>

                                <p>Mr Q dies in January 2021 with an estate worth £600,000. He leaves all of it to his daughter.</p>

                                <p>Step 1. The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at the date of sale was £150,000.</p>

                                <p>Step 2. The flat was worth £90,000 when it was sold. Divide this by the figure at step 1, to give a percentage of 60%.</p>

                                <p>Step 3. There’s no home in the estate at death so the percentage here is 0%.</p>

                                <p>Step 4. Take away the percentage at step 3 (0%) from the percentage at step 2 (60%). The percentage at step 2 is unaltered and remains 60%.</p>

                                <p>Mrs R’s estate is entitled to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £175,000.</p>

There’s also an entitlement to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £175,000 at the date of death. So the total value at step 1 is £300,000 (£125,000 + £175,000).</p>

                                <p>Step 2. The house was sold for £285,000. Divide this by the figure at step 1 to give a percentage of 95%.</p>

                                <p>Step 3. There’s no home in the estate at death so the percentage here is 0%.</p>

                                <p>Step 4. Deduct the percentage at step 3 (0%) from the percentage at step 2 (95%) So the percentage at step 2 is unaltered and remains as 95%.</p>

                                <p>Step 5. The maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> at death is £175,000. There’s also an entitlement to transferred <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £175,000, so the maximum <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> for Mrs R’s estate is £350,000. Multiply this by 95% to give total lost <abbr title="residence nil rate band">RNRB</abbr> of £332,500.</p>
